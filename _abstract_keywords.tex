Luminescent nanocomposite material, ZnO:Ga@SiO$_{2}$-PPIX, for singlet oxygen production and detection is investigated in this work. Photo-induced method and two step biofunctionalization were used for preparation of the material. Nanoparticles were coated with silica and conjugated with PPIX. XRDP, electron microscopy, RL and PL emission spectra and PL decay were carried out to characterize the materials. Fluorescent probe APF and singlet oxygen quencher {\azid} were used for monitoring the singlet oxygen production. XRDP diffraction patterns prove that biofunctionalization do not change the patterns. And luminescent measurement of APF denotes effective singlet oxygen production during X-ray irradiation of the nanocomposite material.
