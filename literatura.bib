abstract = {A novel two-step silica-coating process, sol-gel followed by dense liquid coatings, is described. The maghemite surfaces coated with silica, using the two-step process, are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrokinetics, leaching test, and magnetization measurement. Compared with the single-step sol-gel or dense-liquid-coating process, the two-step process produces magnetic nanocomposites of the highest protection against acid attack at the lowest level of silica coatings with maximized magnetization},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 A highly prospective drug for the X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (PDTX), LuAG:Pr3+@SiO2-PpIX nanocomposite, was successfully prepared by a three step process: photo-induced precipitation of the Lu3Al5O12:Pr3+(LuAG:Pr3+) core, sol–gel technique for amorphous silica coating, and a biofunctionalization by attaching the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) molecules. The synthesis procedure provides three-layer nanocomposite with uniform shells covering an intensely luminescent core. Room temperature radioluminescence (RT RL) spectra as well as photoluminescence (RT PL) steady-state and time resolved spectra of the material confirm the non-radiative energy transfer from the core Pr3+ions to the PpIX outer layer. First, excitation of Pr3+ions results in the red luminescence of PpIX. Second, the decay measurements exhibit clear evidence of mentioned non-radiative energy transfer (ET). The singlet oxygen generation in the system was demonstrated by the 3′-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF) chemical probe sensitive to the singlet oxygen presence. The RT PL spectra of an X-ray irradiated material with the APF probe manifest the formation of singlet oxygen due to which enhanced luminescence around 530 nm is observed. Quenching studies, using NaN3as an1O2inhibitor, also confirm the presence of1O2in the system and rule out the parasitic reaction with OH radicals. To summarize, presented features of LuAG:Pr3+@SiO2-PpIX nanocomposite indicate its considerable potential for PDTX application.},

ZnO:Ga core is coated by the SiO2 shell facilitating a functionalization by a photosensitizer, protoporphyrin PpIX layer. By steady-state and time resolved spectroscopy we confirm the presence of energy transfer between the core and the photosensitizer, an essential requirement to induce a cytotoxic effect. Using the commercial chemical probe we also demonstrate the ability of prepared ZnO:Ga@SiO2-PpIX nanocomposite to generate singlet oxygen. Presented results show that this nanocomposite can be considered as a good candidate for potential application in X-ray induced photodynamic therapy.},

abstract = {Zinc oxide doped with gallium is a scintillating material with large potential for application in many fields including high energy particle physics and time of flight positron emission tomography. Due to its rise time and luminescence decay it is very promising so called ultrafast scintillator. In this work enhancement of ZnO:Ga luminescent properties through preparation of core – shell systems were investigated. ZnMgO and amorphous SiO2 were selected as suitable shell materials. Preparation of ZnMgO shell in sufficient quality wasn't achieved. Application of SiO2 shell led to an increase in luminescence intensity without significant deterioration in the time characteristics of luminescence. Increase in luminescence intensity was also achieved by optimization of ZnO:Ga preparation.},
